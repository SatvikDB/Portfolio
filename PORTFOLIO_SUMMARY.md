## How to Run

1. Navigate to project directory:
   ```bash
   cd React_Projects
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open browser to: http://localhost:5173

## Assumptions Made

1. No live demo links available for projects (using GitHub links only)
2. Using placeholder approach for project images (can be added later)
3. Contact form is simple display of contact info (no backend needed)
4. Static site - no backend or database required
5. All information sourced from resume and GitHub repositories

---

## Data Sources

- **Resume:** Personal information, education, skills, certifications
- **GitHub Profile:** https://github.com/SatvikDB
- **AEGIS Repository:** Full project details and documentation
- **ClassVisionAI Repository:** Complete feature list and tech stack
- **KrishiRaksha:** From resume project description

---

## Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)

1. Add project screenshots/images to public/images/
2. Implement dark/light theme toggle
3. Add animations on scroll (AOS library)
4. Create a blog section
5. Add downloadable resume PDF
6. Implement contact form with backend
7. Add Google Analytics
